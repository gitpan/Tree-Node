NAME
    Tree::Node - Memory-efficient tree nodes in Perl

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.0 or newer is required. Only core modules are used.

    A C compiler to is required to build the module.

INSTALLATION
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use `nmake' instead.)

SYNOPSIS
      use Tree::Node;

      $node = Tree::Node->new(2);

      $node->set_child(0, $left);
      $node->set_child(1, $right);

      while ($node->key_cmp($key) < 0) {
        $node = $node->get_child(0);
      }    

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a memory-efficient node type (for trees, skip
    lists and similar data structures) for Perl.

    You may ask "Why bother implementing an ordered structure such as a tree
    when Perl has hashes built-in?" Since Perl is optimized for speed over
    memory usage, hashes (and lists) use a lot of memory.

    So the purpose of this package is to provide a simple low-level Node
    class which can be used as a base class to implement various kinds of
    tree structures. Each node has a key/value pair and a variable number of
    "children" pointers.

    There is no Pure-perl version because this package was written to
    overcome limitations of Perl.

REVISION HISTORY
    The following changes have been made since the last release:

    0.02  Thu Jun 30 2005
            - minor updates to documentation
            - fixed missing include in TreeNode.c

    See the Changes file for a more detailed list of changes.

KNOWN ISSUES
    This module implements a Perl wrapper around a C struct, which involves
    a blessed reference to a pointer to the struct. This overhead may make
    up for any memory savings that the C-based struct provided.

    This module uses the C `malloc' function, which may cause problems on
    versions of perl earlier than version 5.7.2.
